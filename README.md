  Project folder contains the R file and the final project report.
  
#  Project:
  
  Description:
The project revolves around analyzing the survey data collected from a huge number of customers traveling within the United States and use those data to provide recommendations to the Airlines with the least satisfied customers. The recommendations simply answer business questions to increase revenue and provide suggestions for improvement to the airlines for enhanced customer satisfaction.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to compare FlyFast Airlines with Southeast Airlines Co. so that they can improve their service by increasing their customer's satisfaction. Also, provide them with insights on what parameters are leading to less satisfaction among their customers compared to SouthEast airlines.

Conclusion:
 Satisfaction rating tends to reduce as arrival delay increases 
* Satisfaction rating reduces by around 0.5 If the arrival delay is greater than 5 mins for  Southeast and other airlines. 
* Departure delay affects the Satisfaction rating by a small amount. There is evidence that the satisfaction reduces as departure delay increases, but this is not true for all cases. 
* Age affects satisfaction rating in both Southeast and other airlines. For the age group of 20 to 50, the satisfaction increases. The satisfaction rating decreases as the age increase from 50. 
* When customers travel for personal reasons, their satisfaction is the lowest which is around 2.5
* For Southeast airlines, satisfaction rating tends to increase as the number of flights p.a. decrease.
* In both Southeast Airlines and other airlines, customers traveling by Blue status have the lowest satisfaction rating, followed by Platinum status. 
* Customers who shop between 600-800 give a high customer satisfaction rating for other airlines whereas those who shop for 500-600 give a high customer rating for Southeast airlines.
